        content: `
    Chinese Poker, also known as Big Two, is a popular card game that originated in China and is widely played throughout East Asia and Southeast Asia. It's typically played by four players, although variations exist for different numbers of players.<br/> The game is believed to have evolved from a simpler game called Choh Dai Di, which means "climbing big/little" in Cantonese. Choh Dai Di is a shedding-type card game where players try to get rid of their cards by playing combinations and beating the previously played cards.<br/> Chinese Poker, or Big Two, gained popularity in the mid-20th century. Its rules are relatively simple, making it easy to learn but challenging to master. The game is played with a standard 52-card deck and doesn't involve betting or chips; instead, points or money are kept track of throughout the rounds.`,

        content: `<b>Players:</b><br/><br/>
    The game is ideally played with four players, though variations may accommodate three or even two players.
    <br/><br/><b>Deck:</b><br/><br/>
    A standard 52-card deck is used, typically without the inclusion of jokers.
    <br/><br/><b>Card Distribution:</b><br/><br/>
    Each player receives a total of 13 cards at the beginning of the game.
    The cards are dealt in a clockwise direction from the dealer.
    <br/><br/><b>Determining the Starting Player:</b><br/><br/>
    The starting player is determined based on predefined criteria. The most common rule used is the "3 of Diamonds" rule:
    The player who holds the 3 of diamonds in their hand becomes the starting player for the first round.
    If no player has the 3 of diamonds, other criteria or methods such as random selection, dealer's choice, or the previous round's winner may be used to determine the starting player.
    <br/><br/><b>Additional Points:</b><br/><br/>
    Before the game begins, it's essential to clarify any house rules or variations that will be used during gameplay, such as scoring methods or special combinations that might carry extra privileges.`,

        short: "Card ranking in Big 2",
        content: `
    In most card games, including Chinese Poker (Big 2), the point values of cards from high to low are typically ranked as follows:
    <br/><br/>
2: Highest card value.<br/>
A (Ace): Second highest card value.<br/>
K (King): Third highest card value.<br/>
Q (Queen): Fourth highest card value.<br/>
J (Jack): Fifth highest card value.<br/>
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3: In descending order, with 3 being the lowest in this sequence.<br/><br/>
It's important to note that in Chinese Poker (Big 2), the suits of the cards do not hold any significance in terms of their point values. The ranking of the cards is based solely on their face value as listed above.
<br/>
<br/>
In many traditional card games, suits (colors) don't have intrinsic values, and cards are ranked primarily by their face value. However, in some games, when suit ranking matters, here's a typical hierarchy:
<br/>
<br/>
Suits Ranking (from highest to lowest):<br/>
<b>1. Spades ♠</b><br/>
<b>2. Hearts ♥</b><br/>
<b>3. Diamonds ♦</b><br/>
<b>4. Clubs ♣</b><br/><br/>
Note:<br/><br/>
This ranking is often used in certain games where suits are relevant, such as bridge or some variations of poker.
In most card games, especially Big 2 (Chinese Poker), suits themselves don't hold any inherent value or ranking. The cards are typically ranked solely based on their face value, with the suits being equal.
In games like Chinese Poker (Big 2), the focus is primarily on the face value of the cards, with the suits having no significance in determining the strength or hierarchy of the hands. It's the numerical or face value of the cards that determines their ranking in the game, rather than their suits.`,

    <b>Conservative Start:</b> Begin with moderate hands to conserve strong combinations.<br/>
<b>Hand Management:</b> Distribute strong and weak cards strategically.<br/>
<b>Observation:</b> Analyze opponents' plays to adjust strategies accordingly.<br/>
<b>Timing:</b> Save powerful combinations for later rounds.<br/>
<b>Adaptability:</b> Be flexible and adjust strategies based on gameplay dynamics.<br/><br/>
    In Chinese Poker (Big 2), the opening move can set the tone for the rest of the game. Here are some strategies for your opening move:<br/><br/>
    <b>Start with Moderate Hands:</b> Begin the game with a moderate hand that allows flexibility for future rounds. Avoid using your strongest combinations right away as it might leave you vulnerable later.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Hold onto Strong Cards:</b> While starting conservatively, also aim to retain strong cards for subsequent rounds. These could include pairs, triples, or sequences like straights.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Evaluate Opponents' Initial Moves:</b> Pay attention to the cards your opponents play in the opening round. This can give you an idea of their strategy and hand strength, helping you plan your subsequent moves accordingly.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Balance Hand Distribution:</b> Aim for a balanced distribution of cards that allows flexibility in forming different combinations. This prevents getting stuck with a hand that lacks versatility.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Assess Risk vs. Reward:</b> Consider the risk of playing stronger combinations versus weaker ones. While playing a strong hand might give you an initial lead, it might also attract more attention from opponents.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Observe Passes and Bids:</b> Take note of players who pass in the opening round. They might have weaker hands or are conserving stronger combinations for later use. This information can be valuable for future rounds.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Avoid Overcommitting:</b> While it's crucial to start with a decent hand, avoid overcommitting by playing all your strong combinations early. Holding back some strong cards can give you an advantage in later rounds.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Mind Your Turn Order:</b> Depending on the game's order, if you're the first to play, consider starting with a moderate combination to gauge the field. If you're not the first, observe the initial plays to adjust your strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>
    
    <b>Remember, the opening move is just the beginning. Adapting your strategy as the game progresses based on the moves of your opponents and the cards you receive is equally important in Chinese Poker (Big 2).`,

        content: `
In Chinese Poker (Big 2), the player who should make the opening move is usually determined by specific criteria or game rules agreed upon by the players before the game starts. Here are some common criteria used to determine the starting player:<br/><br/>

<b>3 of Diamonds Rule:</b> The most common rule for determining the starting player is the "3 of Diamonds" rule. According to this rule, the player who holds the 3 of diamonds in their hand has the privilege of making the opening move. If multiple players have the 3 of diamonds, the one closest to the dealer's left usually starts.<br/><br/>

<b>Random Selection:</b> In some variations or casual play, players might choose the starting player randomly. This can be done by shuffling the cards and having each player draw a card, with the player holding the highest or lowest card (depending on the agreed rule) starting the game.<br/><br/>

<b>Dealer's Choice:</b> Sometimes, the dealer might have the discretion to determine the starting player. The dealer could choose themselves or nominate any player to begin the game.<br/><br/>

<b>Previous Round Winner:</b> In a series of games, the winner of the previous round might be given the privilege to start the next round.<br/><br/>

It's essential to establish and agree upon the specific criteria for determining the starting player before the game begins to avoid confusion or disputes during gameplay. The rules for determining the starting player may vary among different groups or regions playing Chinese Poker (Big 2).`,

    Becoming highly skilled at Chinese Poker (Big Two) requires practice, strategy, and a good understanding of the game dynamics. Here are some professional tips to improve your gameplay and strive to become one of the best:
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Understand Card Hierarchy:</b> Memorize the hierarchy of card combinations and their ranks. This knowledge is fundamental to making strategic decisions during the game.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Observation and Memory:</b> Pay close attention to the cards played by opponents. Keeping track of the cards played can help you predict their holdings and plan your moves accordingly.

    <b>Hand Management:</b> Manage your hand wisely. Consider the strength of your combinations and plan ahead to maximize their impact in each round.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Risk Assessment:</b> Assess the risk of playing certain combinations. Sometimes, it's strategic to conserve high-ranking cards for later rounds rather than using them early in the game.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Adaptability:</b> Be flexible in your strategy. Adapt to changing circumstances, such as opponents’ playstyles and the cards played, to adjust your tactics accordingly.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Pattern Recognition:</b> Look for patterns in opponents' playing styles and tendencies. Identifying patterns can help you anticipate their moves and adjust your strategy accordingly.
    <br/><br/>

    <b>Practice Regularly:</b> Like any skill-based game, practice is crucial. Regularly playing against skilled opponents or practicing in different settings (online, with friends, in tournaments) can enhance your skills and strategic thinking.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Learn from Mistakes:</b> Analyze your gameplay and learn from mistakes. Understanding why a certain strategy didn’t work or why a particular move was incorrect can significantly improve your decision-making in future games.
    <br/><br/>
    <b>Stay Calm and Focused:</b> Maintain your composure and focus during the game. Emotional reactions or impulsive decisions can negatively impact your gameplay.

    <br/><br/>
    <b>Enjoy the Game:</b> Lastly, enjoy the game. Passion and enjoyment for the game will fuel your motivation to improve and keep learning.

        color: "#0081a7",
        short: "Scoring systems",
        content: ` 
        <p >Once each player has set his hands, the scores for each player are determined. To do that the individual hands (front/middle/back) for each player are compared with those of the opponents, each hand against each other &ndash; front hand against front hand, middle hand against middle hand and back hand against back hand. The regular Texas Hold&rsquo;em showdown hand values are used for comparison. If you are better in one hand than your opponent, you get one point, if you are worse, your opponent gets one point. If both hands are equally strong, nobody gets a point.</p>
        <p ><em><strong>For example</strong></em>: If you beat your opponent in the front hand and the middle hand but lose in the back hand, you get two points and your opponent gets 1 point (2-1). If there is a tie in a hand, no points are awarded for that hand. If there are one or more tied hands, the combinations 2-0, 1-0, and 1-1 are also possible.</p>
        <br/><h2 >Scoring systems</h2><br/>
        <p>There are many different scoring systems in Chinese Poker and you can even come up with your own system. But all scoring systems have one thing in common: you exchange points with each other, which means that the sum of all points is always zero. How much money a point is worth can be discussed with each player individually.</p>
        <p><em>The following scoring systems are the most commonly found ones:</em></p>
        <br/><h4 >1-6-rule in Chinese Poker</h4><br/>
        <p >The most common scoring system is the 1-6-rule, where a player gets 3 extra points for a 3-0, called a &ldquo;scoop&rdquo;. Thus a 3-0 will give you 6 points, your opponent loses 6 points. With a 2-1 you get 1 point; the opponent loses 1 point. This scoring system is the best one as it rewards trying to scoop your opponents and usually spices up the game.</p>
        <br/><h4>2-4-rule in Chinese Poker</h4><br/>
        <p>Another common scoring system is the 2-4-rule. With this system, a 3-0 score is worth 4 points while the opponent loses 4 points. With a 2-1 you get 2 points; your opponent loses 2 points.</p>
